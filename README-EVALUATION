README-DATA contains detailed description of the data format.

The unlabeled test data, as well as the results of the task participants,
have to be .json files with the same structure as the training data.
However, these files need to contain only the relevant fields: test data will contain texts, ids, and tokens,
while the results should contain only the ids and the model's output relevant to the task: binary classes or span annotation.

The evaluation script is evaluation.oppositional_evaluator.py
The code demonstrating how to perform full build-predict-save json results-evaluate cycle can be found
in the following modules: classif_experiment_eval.py, seqlab_experiment_eval.py
Specifically, you can use the save_text_category_predictions_to_json(),
and save_sequence_label_predictions_to_json() methods to format your predictions in the .json format,
and use the oppositional_evaluator.py script to test evaluation of the predictions against the gold labels.
If you want to fully simulate the evaluation-time procedure, split the available train dataset into train and test,
remove the labels from the test data, change the values of the dataset paths in settings.py, and run the above methods.


********** EVALUATION METRICS **********

For the classification task, the referent evaluation metric is the MCC score (Matthews Correlation Coefficient).
Macro-averaged F1 score and per-class F1 scores will also be reported.

For the sequence labeling task, the referent evaluation metric is the span-F1 score.
The final span-F1 score will be calculated as the average of the span-F1 scores
for each span category, ie, the macro averaged span-F1.
Micro-averaged precision and recall will also be reported.

********** DETAILS OF THE EVALUATION PROCEDURE **********

The evaluation script is evaluation.oppositional_evaluator.py
The script is a standalone python script to be run from the command line:

python oppositional_evaluator.py task1 --gold <path_to_file_with_labels> --predictions <path_to_predictions_file> --outdir <path_to_folder_for_saving_results>
or
python oppositional_evaluator.py task2 --gold <path_to_file_with_labels> --predictions <path_to_predictions_file> --outdir <path_to_folder_for_saving_results>

The script will output the evaluation results to outdir/evaluation.prototext file, in PAN/TIRA format.

********** DETAILS OF THE FORMAT OF THE TEST AND THE PARTICIPANT's OUTPUT DATA **********

Test data will be provided in the same format as the training data.
However, only 'text', 'id', and 'spacy_tokens' fields will be provided.

The task participants will be required to provide the output in the same format as the training data.

For classification, the output must be a list of dictionaries, each with 'id' and 'category' fields.
The 'id' fields will be used to match the output with the original test data, and the IDs
in the output must match the IDs in the test data.
Values of each 'category' field must be one of the two classes: 'CRITICAL' or 'CONSPIRACY'.

For sequence labeling, the output must be a list of dictionaries, each with 'id', 'annotations' fields.
The 'annotations' list must contain dictionaries with 'category', 'start_char', 'end_char' fields.
To signify the absence of the annotation, the 'annotations' list must either be empty,
or contain a single dictionary with 'category' field set to 'X'.

Code that demonstrates the correct formatting of the models' output and the evaluation
against the test data can be found in the following modules:
classif_experiment_eval.py, seqlab_experiment_eval.py
Key are the methods for saving the model predictions in the .json format:
save_text_category_predictions_to_json(), save_sequence_label_predictions_to_json()
For classification, mind the 'positive_class' parameter in the 'evaluate_on_test_dataset' method.
It should reflect the positive class used while training the model.
